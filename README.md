# Kindle eBook Recommendations: A Collaborative and Content Based Approach
Authors: Daniel Burdeno


## Overview
This project aims to build a two system approach to recommending Kindle eBook's to both existing reviewers and new users looking to find similar books. For existing reviewers a collaborative approach is taken by comparing similar reviewer profiles based on exisitng ratings. A content-based approach is taken in order to recommend books based on similar review text data and can be used by anyone.

## Business Problem
Currently eBooks are outsold by print books at about a 4 to 1 ratio. In 2020 there was 191 million eBooks sold. While Amazon holds over 70% of the market in eBooks via their kindle platform there is a large untapped potential for increasing eBook sales and promoting the use of eReaders compared to print. By utilzing quality recommendation systems Amazon can boost the interest and useablity of eBooks thus improving upon this market. The kindle platform and eBooks in general are incredidly accesibile for anyone with a tablet, smartphone, computer, or eReader. These eBooks can be immediatley purchased from a multitude of platforms and are able to read within minutes of purchase, which is far superior to obtaining a print book. This notion of real time purchase and useablily plays greater into Amazon's one click purchase philsophy. 

The kindle store is also full of cheap reads, with some eBooks even being free with certain subsripctions like prime and unlimited. A broad span of genres are available ranging from things like self-help books, cookbooks, and photography books to more traditional literature genres like Science Fiction & Fantasy and Romance novels. A final huge plus for the advocacy of eBooks is the ease in which readers can rate and reviews books they have either just read or already read. This can all be done via the same platform used to access and read the eBook (aka kindle). Ultimately this plays into the collection of more review and rating data wich in turn can attribute to better performing recommendations for each indiviudal user. A quality recommendation system can thus create a positive feedback loop that not only enhances itself but promotoes the increase in eBook sales across the board.

## Data Understanding
Data for this project was pulled from a compiled dataset of Amazon kindle store reviews and meta data in two seperate JSON files. The datasets can be found [here](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html). I utlized the smaller dataset known as 5-core which contained data for products and reviewers with at least 5 entries. Data from the Kindle Store sets were used, both the 5-core review data and the full metadata file. Due to the large size of these datasets I downloaded them locally and saved to an external repository outside of github.

Review Data:

Meta Data
![meta]()

Once the data was loaded in, cleaned, and processed I saved seperate csv files locally as well, again due to size constraints. Several data sets including a reduced user dataframe and two meta data files were saved and pushed to github as seen in the repository structure. These files are needed for heroku to run the app that was developed.

## Data Preparation
For data preparation and cleaning I primarily used built-in pandas methods and functions. The meta data was heavily cleaned to extract relevant information for this project including author, genre, page lengths, and kinde features. Meta data and review data was matched using 'asin' field, a unique product ID number generated by Amazon. As this project was focused soley on eBooks, I removed any products that did not match this. Review data was truncate to only included verified reviews, removing any potential paid sponsor reviews which could be skewed positively. 

For the collaborative filtering approach I removed any reviewer who had less than 5 book ratings in order to achieve quality results. A main limitation of collaborative filtering is the need for existing fleshed out user profiles. These reviews were left in for the content-based approach to provide more text data. In order to extract relevant information from text reviews I compiled all the reviews for each book into a new dataframe that could be used with nature language processing tools.

## Methods and Models
I utilized two seperate approachs in order to produce a range of eBook recommendations: a collaborative filtering (CF) system and a content-based (CB) system. I choose to attempt a dual approach to providing recommendations so I could address a potential cold start problem. The CF system can only be used by existing book reviewers who have previously rated books, while the CB system can be used by anyone looking to find book recommendations, based on similar boks. Once users have read and rated a set of books, this new reviewer data can be entered into the data pipeline and the CF model retrained to provide recommendations for these users. For each of these approachs a function was written that can return n-recommendations for eBooks. These functions were then used to produce a heroku app which can be deployed to provide quality recommendations.

### Collaborative Filtering
The CF system was based on reviewer rating data to create 'user profiles' which could then be compared with one another. Similar users, based on prior eBook ratings, were then used to return the top recommended books by predicting an estimated rating. This approach is known as user to user. I iterated through several model algorithms and grid searchs before settling on my final model (SVD GS3). This model achieved my lowest Root Mean Squared Error, coming in at 0.781 rating (RMSE).

The CF system function takes in a reviewers unique Amazon ID and returns n-recommendations based on their profile in comparison to other users. This is demonstrated below. As one can see the CF system returns a variety of genres and eBook content and is based on prior reviewed books from the reviewer.

For a more in depth look at this process please see my Collaborative Filtering [notebook](https://github.com/danielburdeno/Kindle-Recommendations/blob/main/CollaborativeFiltering.ipynb).

### Content-Based
The CB system was based on review text data which was compiled together for every book in my data set. Each book's review text acted as a document within the larger text corpus (all books). The Texthero package was utlized to clean and prepare review text for feature extraction. Texthero is a relatively new package that helps to streamline many natural language processing tools, and can be used to create custom cleaning pipelines for text data. Please see the [documentation](https://texthero.org/docs/getting-started) and [github](https://github.com/jbesomi/texthero) for more information and other uses. 

Content features for the corpus were then extracted from the cleaned review text data using the standard sklearn Tfidfvectorizor. Tf-idf scores were then combined with genre and print length data mined from the meta dataset. I purposely exlcuded using author as a feature to make sure the model woudln't just return book series or same authors as I wanted a larger variety of recommendations. The created function takes in a book title and n number of recommendations, provided by the user, and returns book recommendations. As expected from a CB system returned recommendations follow genre lines. 

I want to highlight below, using two eBook examples, how this recommendation system is able to distinguish between content within genres. Both of the inputted eBooks are within the Literature and Fiction Genre however contain vastly different content, one is a thriller and the other a romance. Recommendations for these books follow the same convention.

Thriller:
